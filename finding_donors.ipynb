    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Decision Trees \n",
    "\n",
    "(a). A recommendation system. The company is able to use decision tree algorithm to determine the commercial, the items and the offers for better buyer's satisfication. \n",
    "\n",
    "(b). Easy to use: Decision trees does not require too much computation. It can handle both continuous and categorical variables, and provide a clear indication of the most important fields for prediction or classification. It does not require some data transformation of normalization or scaling. Flexibility: Decision trees does not require comprehensive quantitative data, it can handle items with mixture of real-valued numerical data and categorical features, and items with some missing features. For categorical feature data, we don't need to create a dummy variable to work around this. Resilience: Decision trees can deal with interactions of variables, so that we know \"online pharmcy\" is spam while \"online\" and \"pharmcy\" is good. Feature selection: Decision trees can perform feature selection automatically. Decision Trees in general works well if your feature variable are related.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c). Overfit: Decision trees divide the data into squares to build clusters around the data. The Spliting a lot leads to complex tress and raises probability of overfitting model. Complexity: Model need to recreate from stratch in order to incorporate new data. With larger data sets the number of nodes can grow extremely large and complex. Decision trees do not perfrom well if you have smooth boundaries. Decision trees don't work best if you have a lot of un-correlated variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d). Before we do the feature convertion (categorical and numbercal), I have thought about use decision trees since it works if the dataset contain both categorical and umerical data. Also, decision trees can tell you that what features are more important in the result. We can avoid the noise feature later if there is any. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "(a). Healthcare application: Analyzing a group of over million people for heart attack within a period of long time so that we can predict if people with similiar situation would get heart attack or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "(b). Flexibility : Logistic Regression works with continuous and/or categorical features to predict categorical outcome variable. Robust: The independent variables don't have to be normally distributed, or have equal variance in each group. It doesn’t require input features to be scaled. Easy to use: it doesn’t require any tuning, it’s easy to regularize. Logistic models can be updated easily with new data using stochastic gradient descent. Outliers: Logistic regression is robust to outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "(c).Limited outcome variables: Logistic regression works well for predicting categorical outcome and multinominal outcomes. However, it can not predict continuous outcomes. The limitation for logistic regression is that the outcome variable must be discreteOverweight: Logistic regression requires that each data point be independent of all other data points. If they are realted to one another, then the model will tend to overweight the significance of those observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "(d). The reason I choose logistic regression is because it performs well in genral and does not require to complicated hyperparameter tuning. Also, as mentioned above, logistic regression works with both categorical and numerical features(although we have transferred all numercal feature to categorical ones). The last reason would be Logistic regression is robust to the outliers data and I think this dataset might have some outliers data since there are many numerical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) AdaBoostClassifier\n",
    "\n",
    "(a). Face recognition with Viola-Jones face detector. \n",
    "\n",
    "(b). Eassy to use: Unlike other powerful classifiers, such as SVM, AdaBoost can achieve similar classification results with much less tweaking of parameters or settings. The user only needs to choose: which weak classifier might work best to solve their given classification problem and the number of boosting rounds that should be used during the training phase. Feature selection: Adaboost performs feature selection on very large sets of features. Flexibility: Adaboost can combine with any learning algorithm that it suitable for the dataset. Improve classifier accuracy: Adaboost is optimization process of the classifier so ideally it is going to improve the accuracy. Overfitting: It is relatively unlikely to overfit.   \n",
    "\n",
    "(c). Noise: Adaboost is sensitive to noisy data and outliers. Performance: In the event of insufficient data set, it has a poor performance in too complex and too weak hypotheses. Complexity: Must adjust to handle multiclass tasks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(d). The reason to choose adaboost is that it is a boosting algorithm. My idea was hoping that the boosting is able to improve the accuracy on wahtever the learning algorithm that I am applying. Also, the features of the data have been extended to 103 dimention. I am hoping that by applying Adaboost, it could help me perform some features selection when training the model.  \n",

    "1. Based on the visualization above and my guess in Question 6, I successfully guess four of them correct but I did not considerate education-num in the beginning and it turns out that the relationship does not matter too much. Those five features on the visualization have provided around 55% of the information of the dataset.\n",
    "2. The visualization confrims that the capical-loss and the capital-gain are the top features that are going to affect your income, which is the same with what I have described in Question 6. The combination of those two features are able to provide around 25% of the information of the data. The age feature is actually a more informative feature than I thought. It itself provides around 15% of the information of the dataset. The hours-per-week is also an informative feature as what I guessed in Question 6. \n",
    "3. The only two things that I missed were relationship and education-num. I think one of the reasons is that education-num feature has more levels of information (5.0, 9.0, 13.0, 14.0 ...) so that it has stronger ability to impact and tell the output of the data. The Relationship feature on the other hand has only a few levels (not family, husband, and wife...), which has weaker ability to determine the output result, which turns out to be a less informative feature. **"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "2. The trainng time was definitelly way faster and both F=score and accrualy are a bit lower than before. If the training time is a key factor to to determine a good clasifier for us, then I would think it is worth using only top 5 features. I totally agree that the features we are using might be not good enough. If we use all features, there must be some noise that is affecting the result. However, I think the way we are going to fix is to apply PCA (principal component analysis) or some dimentionly reduction technique to reduce the feature dimention in a more proper way without losing too much data information. If we directly only consider top 5 informative features, it is not necessary result in a better accuracy (especially in the case that the top 5 informative features contribue only just around 55% information of the data ), we might also lose many inforamtion from other features. **"
